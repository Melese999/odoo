Key Features
============

*   **Comprehensive Call Logging**: Log telemarketing-specific calls directly within a Lead/Opportunity via a dedicated "Telemarketing" tab. This is separate from the standard Odoo Logged Calls.
*   **Advanced KPI Tracking**: Fulfills specific AMG CRM requirements by providing fields to track:
    *   **Outbound KPIs**: Brand Awareness Created, Quality of Information Delivered (Rating), and Generated Sales Orders.
    *   **Inbound KPIs**: If detailed information was provided and if a follow-up was scheduled.
    *   **Customer Satisfaction**: Fields for Service Rating and Product Rating for survey-type calls.
*   **Lead Data Quality Scoring**:
    *   A "Data Quality Score" is automatically calculated on each lead based on confirmation checks (name, address, phone) performed during calls.
    *   This score is displayed as a clickable stat button on the Lead form, opening a history of all calls for that lead.
*   **Unified Telemarketing Reports**: A powerful reporting view that combines data from both custom telemarketing calls and standard Odoo phone calls (`crm.phonecall`) into a single, unified interface with Tree, Pivot, and Graph views.
*   **Custom OWL Dashboard**: A modern, real-time dashboard built with OWL and Chart.js. It displays key KPIs, a pivot table of calls by user and direction, and a bar chart of call volume over time. The dashboard refreshes automatically.
*   **Configurable Call Statuses**: A dedicated menu under CRM configuration to define custom "Detailed Statuses" for telemarketing calls, allowing for flexible workflow management.

3.  Assign a "Type" to each status to categorize it for reporting.

Usage
=====
