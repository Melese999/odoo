This module introduces a flexible and powerful lead scoring system to your Odoo CRM, replicating a key feature of the Enterprise edition. It allows sales managers to define a set of rules that automatically assign a numerical score to leads and opportunities. This enables the sales and telemarketing teams to prioritize their efforts, focusing on the most promising prospects first and improving overall efficiency.

This module is a core component of the AMG CRM suite and directly addresses the need to evaluate lead potential beyond simple data completeness.

Key Features
============

*   **Configurable Scoring Rules**: Create custom rules based on any field on the Lead/Opportunity model.
*   **Flexible Odoo Domains**: Use the full power of Odoo's domain syntax to precisely target which leads should be scored.
*   **Positive & Negative Scoring**: Assign positive points for desirable attributes (e.g., high budget, specific country) and negative points for undesirable ones.
*   **Automatic Calculation**: Scores are automatically computed and updated when a lead is created or modified.
*   **UI Integration**: The calculated "Lead Score" is displayed directly on the Lead/Opportunity form and as an optional column in the list view, making it easy to sort and prioritize.

Installation
============

1.  Add this module and its dependencies (e.g., `crm_telemarketing`) to your Odoo addons path.
2.  Restart the Odoo server.
3.  Navigate to the `Apps` menu, find `AMG CRM Lead Scoring`, and click `Install`.

Configuration
=============

To configure the lead scoring system:

1.  Navigate to `CRM > Configuration > Lead Scoring Rules`.
2.  Click "New" or edit the list directly to create your scoring rules.
3.  For each rule, provide:
    *   **Rule Name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "High-Value Lead", "Key Industry").
    *   **Domain**: An Odoo domain to filter the leads that this rule applies to.
    *   **Score Value**: The number of points to add (positive) or subtract (negative).

**Example Domains:**

*   Score leads from a specific country: `[('country_id.name', '=', 'United States')]`
*   Score leads with a high budget: `[('expected_revenue', '>', 50000)]`
*   Score leads from a specific source: `[('source_id.name', '=', 'Website')]`
*   Combine rules (OR): `['|', ('partner_name', 'ilike', 'Inc'), ('tag_ids.name', 'in', ['VIP'])]`

Usage
=====

Once the rules are configured, the scoring is automatic.

*   **Sales/Telemarketing Teams**: In the Leads or Pipeline view, make the "Lead Score" column visible (via the three-dot menu on the list header). Sort by this column in descending order to work on the highest-potential leads first.
*   **Managers**: The score provides a quick, data-driven overview of the quality of the lead pipeline.
